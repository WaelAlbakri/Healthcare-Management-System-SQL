## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used

- Relational database design & normalization (3NF)
- `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints
- `JOIN`s across multiple tables
- Aggregate functions with `GROUP BY`
- Subqueries for nested analysis
- `CASE` statements for readable outputs
- One-to-many and one-to-one relationship mapping

## ✅ How to Run

1. Open MySQL (or any compatible SQL database).
2. Execute `schema.sql` to create tables.
3. Run `data.sql` to populate test records.
4. Explore reports and analysis using `queries.sql`.
